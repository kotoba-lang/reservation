(ns kotoba.reservation
  "Reservable inventory, holds, rate plans and quotes — pure data contracts.

  A kotoba-lang capability library for the reservation-bearing
  cloud-itonami open businesses: passenger air transport
  (`cloud-itonami-isic-5110`), accommodation (`-5510`/`-5590`), travel
  agency (`-7911`), tour operator (`-7912`) and other reservation
  services (`-7990`). No network, no I/O, no ambient clock. Models the
  two things every one of those businesses needs and that no prior
  kotoba-lang capability library supplied: **how many are left to sell**
  and **what this one costs**.

  Portable (.cljc) across JVM / ClojureScript / SCI / GraalVM.

  ## Determinism, and why there are no floats here

  Every amount is an integer in the currency's MINOR UNIT (JPY: 1 = ¥1;
  USD: 1 = 1 cent). Every rate modifier is an integer in BASIS POINTS
  (`bp-scale` = 10000 bp = 100%), applied with truncating integer
  division. There is no floating-point arithmetic anywhere in this
  namespace, so a quote recomputed on a different runtime is bit-identical
  to the one recomputed here — which is the whole point of `quote-total`
  being independently re-runnable by a governor (see
  `quote-matches-claim?`).

  Truncation is a real decision, not an oversight: `apply-bp` rounds
  toward zero, so a modifier can only ever move a fare DOWN by a
  sub-unit, never up. An operator whose filed fare rules require a
  different rounding must apply it in its own filing and pass the
  resulting `:rate/base-amount` — this library will not silently pick a
  rounding convention on their behalf.

  ## No clock; calendar only when you ask for it

  `expired?` takes `now` as an argument, and nothing in this namespace
  ever reads a clock. That one matters for reproducibility: a governor
  recomputing a proposal minutes later must get the same answer, so
  wall-clock time is always an argument, never an ambient read.

  `quote-for` likewise takes each date's weekday as data rather than
  deriving it. The reason is NOT reproducibility — deriving the weekday
  of \"2026-08-01\" is deterministic and would give the same answer
  forever. (An earlier version of this docstring claimed otherwise; it
  was wrong, and the wrong rationale is corrected here rather than left
  for the next reader to copy.) The actual reasons are that the core
  pricing path should not bake in one calendar system, and that callers
  may key modifiers on something other than a proleptic-Gregorian
  weekday — a fiscal week, a local holiday table, a season.

  For callers who DO want proleptic-Gregorian arithmetic, `weekday-of`
  and `nights-between` provide it explicitly, as opt-in pure functions.
  They are how an accommodation caller turns a stay's own check-in and
  check-out into the nights to price, so that a governor recomputes the
  total from the booking's own dates rather than from a night list the
  advisor supplied and could have shortened."
